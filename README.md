An example of the manipulation of a matrix with integer elements $\mathbf{A}$, using memory allocation in \emph{C}. Hereafter the concepts of \emph{malloc} and \emph{mask} will be explained for a better understanding of the proposed method.

The matrix $\mathbf{A} = a_{i,j}$ with $0\leq i \leq M$, $0\leq j \leq N$ arrangement of integer numbers is proposed for this memory access study. The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is manipulated using the surronding elments of each $a_{i,j}$ to obtain a modified $\mathbf{B}$ matrix of integer elements. The goal of the method will be a sort of steps that correlate a one dimensional memory organization with a two dimensional matrix arrangement.
